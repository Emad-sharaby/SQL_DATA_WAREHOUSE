# SQL_DATA_WAREHOUSE

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse Project**.  
In this project, we are trying to create a **data warehouse** using structured steps and best practices.

---

## ðŸš€ Steps

1. **Importing Data**  
   - We import data from two data sources: **ERP** and **CRM**.  
   - Each source includes three CSV files.

2. **Cleaning Data**  
   - Handle missing values, fix formatting issues, correct data types, and standardize values.

3. **Combine Sources**  
   - Merge **ERP** and **CRM** data into one unified data model.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Scope

- Focus only on the **latest dataset**, excluding outdated or archived data.
